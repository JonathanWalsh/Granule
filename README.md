Overview
=======
This repository forked from [JonathanWalsh/Granule](JonathanWalsh/Granule)

I was using Granule in one of my project.

The issue I faced was, by default I was gZipping all the files served from my server.

Granule, by default giving the gZipped output.

There might be other ways to disable this, but thought that it would be better to have an option in this library itself.

So, Forked and updated the code to have a new option with the name "enable-gzip", which accepts either true or false, by default it is true.
